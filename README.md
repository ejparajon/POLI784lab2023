# UNC Political Science POLI784 Lab
Regression Models is a graduate-level course provided once a year within the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâ€™s Political Science Department. It is the second course in the threecourse Political Methodology sequence, and is required for all individuals within the Political Science Ph.D. program. The course was taught by Professor Santiago Olivella, and I served as the teaching assistant and led the accompanying lab. This repo contains labs, assignments, and answer keys for POLI 784 offered in Spring of 2023.
